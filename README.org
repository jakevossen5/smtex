Welcome to smtex! This is a program that lets you turn LaTeX code into photos over SMS!

** Usage
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: usage
   :END:

*Text your LaTeX code to the number =(970) 400-1784= and get it rendered and sent back to you!*

For example: send =x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 -4ac}}{2a}= to get back this beautiful image of
everyone's favourite quadratic equation.

** Why?

   :CUSTOM_ID: why
   :END:

As a student, I often find myself trying to send equations over sms.  Very often it ends up looking
like something like =x = (int(x^2 - 23x)/(sqrt(4x))dx)=. That's dumb. Whenever I see a piece of text
like that it just makes me want to give up because of how unreadable it is. I am also quite
proficient in LaTeX, so I figured if I could type LaTeX quickly I could send equations with much
better communication efficiency.
